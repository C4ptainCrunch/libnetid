# Real life testing

This folder can be used to test `libnetid` with real responses from the API.
All you have to do is to dump here some files ending with `.xml`

It is empty in the git repository because responses from the API are personal data and cannot be shared publicly. I (@C4ptainCrunch) am currently testing the lib with ~650 different responses gathered from https://dochub.be/.

Most responses in my dump are from students of the ULB but I also have some VUB students. Unfortunately it does not contain any professor, academic staff or PATGS. If you posses some of those, please consider contacting me :)

Note: *This folder must be kept in the source tree even if it's empty*
